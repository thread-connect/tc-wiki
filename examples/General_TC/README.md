## Route on Content/Attribute
<details><summary>Sample Documentation</summary>
This flow contains an example of routing a flowfile to a path based on text within the content of that FlowFile. This flow also contains an example of routing a flowfile to a path based on a value contained within some specific attribute.

One example which can highlight the use of both the RouteOnContent and RouteOnAttribute processors is routing of a flowfile based on an incoming HTTP request.

* RouteOnContent processor could route the flowfile to some destination based on the body of the HTTP request
* RouteOnAttribute processor could route the flowfile to some destination based on type of incoming HTTP request. This processor would route the flowfile based on the value of attribute http.method
