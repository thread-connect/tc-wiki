# Thread Connect User Guide

Thread Connect is an extended version of Apache NiFi so to understand how to use Thread Connect, you must know how to use Apache NiFi. Apache NiFi is an extremely robust product and does not come without complexities. Apache NiFi has a very active community of developers and there is a wealth of information on it's use. A list of links to official documentation for NiFi is provided below. Only after understanding that documentation will the full potential of Thread Connect be unlocked. Items that are custom to Thread Connect are documented here as well as information on examples which the Thread Connect team has compiled for common use cases. The examples are a great way to get started with Thread Connect. 

We recommend reading thru the Apache NiFi documentation before starting with Thread Connect and subscribing to the NiFi User Group disribution list if you plan to be seriously using Thread Connect as the majority of questions and issues will be related to technical challenges building data flows.

## Trying Out Examples
The Thread Connect Team has compiled a list of common use cases and created example templates to help users get started in understanding the power of TC. The list will continue to grow and is by no means exhaustive. To try out one of the example templates, do the following:
1. Clone or download this repo
2. Upload the template xml file to the TC canvas by using the template upload button
3. Drag the top level Template toolbar item onto the canvas
4. Select the uploaded template
5. Start the data flow

While the TC Team has made every effort to make this as easy as possible, there may be cases where some modification will need to be made for the data flow to run. This will be a good opportunity to trace the data flow and understand its use case. Specific details on each of the examples are in the readme of the examples directory of this repo.
