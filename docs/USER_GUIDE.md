# Thread Connect User Guide

Thread Connect is an extended version of Apache NiFi so to understand how to use Thread Connect, you must know how to use Apache NiFi. Apache NiFi is an extremely robust product and does not come without complexities. Apache NiFi has a very active community of developers and there is a wealth of information on it's use. A list of links to official documentation for NiFi is provided below. Only after understanding that documentation will the full potential of Thread Connect be unlocked. Items that are custom to Thread Connect are documented here as well as information on examples which the Thread Connect team has compiled for common use cases. The examples are a great way to get started with Thread Connect. 

We recommend reading thru the Apache NiFi documentation before starting with Thread Connect. We also recommend subscribing to the NiFi User Group disribution list if you plan to be seriously using Thread Connect as it is a very active user group and there is a wealth of knowledge and experience available in this group. From our experience so far with Thread Connect, the majority of technical issues are purely technical difficulties with Apache NiFi and its use in building integrations and data flows.
