# Getting Help and Support
One of the many goals of the Thread Connect team is to ensure that users are able to use the product as quickly and as easily as possible. Thread Connect is an extremely powerful product that can bring a ton of value in its use. However, the product does come with its complexities. Learning how to use the product does take some time for new users and the Thread Connect team is constantly looking for ways to reduce the learning curve for new (and experienced) users. 

Generally when a user needs help it is going to fall in one of two areas: platform help or development help.

## Platform Help
Platform help is needed when an issue is outside the control of a user. Here are a couple examples of platform help:

> A user subscribes to Thread Connect on Predix and the log in screen isn't able to be accessed after waiting a significant amount of time (half an hour).

> A user with a subscription on Predix gets an internal error message from the Canvas that doesn't self correct and is not longer able to access the canvas UI. 

> A user subscribes to Thread Connect on Predix and the Cloud Foundry service instance shows as "create in progress" and never completes. 


In cases as above, users should follow the support guide for the specific platform they are using Thread Connect on. A request for support should be put in and the standard SLA will apply. In addition to putting in the support request, we encourage users to also put a message in our Support Chat forum. We want our users to be using Thread Connect, not being blocked by these kinds of issues. We monitor our Support Chat forum very closely and typically if someone is available at that moment, they are going to jump in to help.

## Development Help
Development help is going to be with issues encountered when developing data flows and integrations on Thread Connect. This is going to be the most common type of help. This help is not typically going to be platform specific, but where to get help for development issues will depend on whether or not the development includes any Thread Connect custom components. If you are not sure, please see the [Thread Connect User Guide](USER_GUIDE.md) to determine whether or not it is a custom component or a standard component. The reason is that if it is a custom component, really the help will need to come from the Thread Connect team (or other TC users) whereas if it is a standard component, the Apache NiFi community and internet will typically be the best place to start. Regardless of whether or not it is a custom component, we encourage users to put out a message in our Support Chat forum. We can and want to help!


## Support Chat Forum
Our support chat form(s) are going to be the quickest and most direct way to interact with the Thread Connect team. We really encourage our users to utilize this as any messages put on here are going to get the quickest response. Also this is a good place to search for previous questions asked and the answers to those questions.
