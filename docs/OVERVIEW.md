# Overview


## What is Thread Connect
ThreadConnect (TC) is a containerized, elastic, fully managed, advanced Integration  (IPaas) on the Predix Container Service (PCS) cloud that helps build, deploy, maintain, and monitor complex and data intensive integrations for a wide variety of commonly used data sources across Enterprises.

As of now, the ThreadConnect Integration Platform as a Service (IPaaS) is available to all Predix Customers which was previously only available to the GE internal customers during the Beta release.

## What is Thread Connect Used For
Use ThreadConnect to build seamless data integrations within minutes using drag-and-drop configurable connectors and processors. Reduce development time, abstract the complexity of end-point connectivity, and eliminate the operational overhead of monitoring with elastic and auto-scaled in a containerized Infrastructure.

User-friendly UI with its purpose-built, write-ahead log and content repository lets you design flows and run-time environments visually with horizontal scaling, guaranteed delivery, and resiliency built-in, out-of-the-box, and in real time.

Additional Features and Benefits 
 
- Connect to various ERPs using connectors that can communicate natively and are easy to configure
- Serverless architecture with Elastic/Auto-Scaling support various workloads.
- Provide a simple data mapping capability for faster development.
- Build a flow using drag-and-drop of processors and chain the processors and connectors
- Consume change data-capture events through messaging connectors and pub-sub events or topics
- Get full resiliency capability to reprocess messages in addition to guaranteed delivery
- Set up fine grain policy control and provide or consume APIs in a secure way
- Transform and orchestrate flows between different system end points
- Manage latency, throughput, and loss tolerance with the fine-grained flow-specific configuration and QoS. 
- The content repository design provides a rolling buffer of history. Data is removed only as it ages or as space is needed, then it scales out by clustering many nodes together. 
- System-to-system security at every point in a data-flow offers secure exchange through the use of protocols with encryption, such as 2-way SSL. 

## Why Use Thread Connect
TC service can be used by any customers who need to integrate between disparate systems, across firewalls, and manage data across through these end points. There are number of Predix applications or services that need data from on premise systems or vice-versa in real-time. Instead of every application trying to integrate on its own, ThreadConnect abstracts the complexity of connectivity and provides reusable APIs to integrate Predix applications to on-premise Enterprise ERP systems. The out-of-the-box ThreadConnect has native connectors that can exchange real-time data natively using different protocols. Data flows in ThreadConnect can be  orchestrated by context-based routing and orchestration using reusable canonical models that are Industry standard.
