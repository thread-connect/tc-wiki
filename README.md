# Welcome to Thread Connect

Thread Connect (TC) is an advanced, enterprise ready platform, for building complex data integrations. TC is currently available on Predix as a service for both internal and external GE users and is also available on AWS for internal GE users only. TC is continually evolving to meet the needs of our users and there is ongoing development to reach additional use cases. Feel free to send a message on our [support forum](docs/GENERAL_SUPPORT.md#support-chat-forum) for questions about our current development or upcoming releases. We welcome and greatly appreciate feature requests too :tada:
